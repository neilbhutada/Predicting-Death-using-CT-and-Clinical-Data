# Predicting-Death-using-CT-and-Clinical-Data


In this project, we created a Gradient Boosting Machine Learning model and Weighted K-NN to predict the number of days to death from CT data and Clinical Data. We also developed a new feature called "Biological Age" that boosted the performance of our model. 

I unfortunately cannot upload the data because it has confidential information about patients. However, feel free to check the pdf <a href = "https://github.com/neilbhutada/Predicting-Death-using-CT-and-Clinical-Data/blob/main/CS760_FinalProject.pdf"> link </a> of the write-up.
